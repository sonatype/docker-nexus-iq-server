## Migration

### Upgrading from Version 124 or Earlier to Version 125 or Later
Version 1.125.0 of the Docker image changed the base image from [Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image)](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi/5c359854d70cc534b3a3784e) to [Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image) Minimal](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8-minimal/5c64772edd19c77a158ea216). As part of this, `dnf` is replaced by `microdnf` as the package manager.

### Upgrading from Release 118 to Release 119 or Later
The sonatype/nexus-iq-server docker image for IQ release 119 has fixed the issue with non-graceful shutdown of the IQ server. For stopping the IQ docker instance prior to release 119 (for the purpose of upgrading to 119 or any other reason) you would need to use the following command.

```
docker exec -ti $(docker container list -a | grep nexus-iq | head -n 1 | awk '{print$1}') bash -c 'kill -TERM "$(cat /sonatype-work/lock | cut -d"@" -f1)"'
```

Where the portion of the command surrounded by $(docker ...) returns the docker container_id of the IQ server. If you have already identified the container_id of the running IQ server, you can alternatively run the below command by replacing the container_id with the id of the container you have identified:

```
docker exec -ti container_id bash -c 'kill -TERM "$(cat /sonatype-work/lock | cut -d"@" -f1)"'
```


### Upgrading from Version 117 or Earlier to Version 118 or Later
Version 1.118.0 of the Docker image changed the UID of the nexus user from 997 to 1000, and changed it from a system account to a user account. This is to minimize the chance of a future collision with other UIDs. If you use this image with persistent data volumes, then for each volume you will need to run the following command:
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v [volume name]:[volume container path] sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.118.0 chown -R nexus:nexus [volume container path]
```
e.g.
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v sonatype-work:/sonatype-work sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.118.0 chown -R nexus:nexus /sonatype-work
```
This will start up a 1.118.0 IQ server container with root as the user, allowing it to chown the sonatype-work directory and its files to the correct nexus user.

### Upgrading from Version 100 or Earlier to Version 101 or Later
Version 1.101.0 of the Docker image changed the base image from [Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image)](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi/5c359854d70cc534b3a3784e) to a different [Red
Hat UBI that includes OpenJDK 1.8](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/openjdk-8/5dd6a48dbed8bd164a09589a). This was due to an effort to remove the dependency on Chef. As a result, the UID of
the `nexus` user has changed. If you use this image with persistent data volumes, then for each volume you will need to
run the following command:
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v [volume name]:[volume container path] sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.101.0 chown -R nexus:nexus [volume container path]
```
e.g.
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v sonatype-work:/sonatype-work sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.101.0 chown -R nexus:nexus /sonatype-work
```
This will start up a 1.101.0 IQ server container with `root` as the user, allowing it to chown the sonatype-work directory
and its files to the correct `nexus` user.

### Upgrading from Version 68 or Earlier to Version 69 or Later
Version 1.69.0 of the Docker image changed the base image from [CentOS](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos) to [Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Image)](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/ubi/5c359854d70cc534b3a3784e).
As a result, the UID of the `nexus` user has changed. If you use this image with persistent data volumes, then for each
volume you will need to run the following command:
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v [volume name]:[volume container path] sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.69.0 chown -R nexus:nexus [volume container path]
```
e.g.
```
docker run -it -u=0 -v sonatype-work:/sonatype-work sonatype/nexus-iq-server:1.69.0 chown -R nexus:nexus /sonatype-work
```
This will start up a 1.69.0 IQ server container with `root` as the user, allowing it to chown the sonatype-work directory
and its files to the correct `nexus` user.

## Runtime Server Configuration

Installation of Nexus IQ Server application is to `/opt/sonatype/nexus-iq-server`.

By default, the IQ Server reads its [main configuration file](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/configuring/config.yml) from within the image at `/etc/nexus-iq-server/config.yml`.

There is an environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` that passes JVM arguments to the java command that launches IQ server.

This environment variable can be adjusted at runtime:

```
docker run -d -p 8070:8070 -p 8071:8071 --name nexus-iq-server -e JAVA_OPTS="-Doption=value" sonatype/nexus-iq-server
```

Further, you can [customize parts of the default config.yml settings by using Java system properties](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/configuring/advanced-server-configuration) defined inside the environment variable.

Example: To customize the logging level that IQ Server will use:

```
docker run -d -p 8070:8070 -p 8071:8071 --name nexus-iq-server -e JAVA_OPTS="-Ddw.logging.level=TRACE" sonatype/nexus-iq-server
```

### Runtime Server Configuration for Versions 101 and 102

Note that for version 101 and 102 `${JAVA_OPTS}` is missing from the startup script `start.sh` and so,
in addition to your command modifying the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable (similar to the above), you must also run
```
docker exec nexus-iq-server sed -i 's/java/java \${JAVA_OPTS}/g' /opt/sonatype/nexus-iq-server/start.sh
docker restart nexus-iq-server
```

## Persistent Data

There are two general approaches to handling persistent storage requirements
with Docker. See [Managing Data in Containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/)
for additional information.

  1. *Use a data volume*.  Since data volumes are persistent
  until no containers use them, a volume can be created specifically for
  this purpose.  This is the recommended approach.

  ```
  docker volume create --name sonatype-work
  docker volume create --name sonatype-logs
  docker run -d -p 8070:8070 -p 8071:8071 --name nexus-iq-server -v sonatype-work:/sonatype-work -v sonatype-logs:/var/log/nexus-iq-server sonatype/nexus-iq-server
  ```

  2. *Mount a host directory as the volume*.  This is not portable, as it
  relies on the directory existing with correct permissions on the host.
  However it can be useful in certain situations where this volume needs
  to be assigned to certain specific underlying storage.

  ```
  mkdir /some/dir/sonatype-work
  mkdir /some/dir/sonatype-logs
  docker run -d -p 8070:8070 -p 8071:8071 --name nexus-iq-server -v /some/dir/sonatype-work:/sonatype-work -v /some/dir/sonatype-logs:/var/log/nexus-iq-server sonatype/nexus-iq-server
  ```

## Running

To run with ports 8070 (web UI) and 8071 (admin port) use:

    docker run -d -p 8070:8070 -p 8071:8071 --name nexus-iq-server sonatype/nexus-iq-server

or to let docker assign available ports use:

    docker run -d -p 8070 -p 8071 --name nexus-iq-server sonatype/nexus-iq-server

To get the assigned port or check if the server is running use:

    docker ps --filter "name=nexus-iq-server"
    
When **stopping**, be sure to allow sufficient time for the databases to fully shut down.  

```
docker stop --time=180 <CONTAINER_NAME>
```
If running version 118 or earlier, then use the following approach (direct SIGTERM) for stopping the container:

```
docker exec -ti <CONTAINER_NAME> bash -c 'kill -TERM "$(cat /sonatype-work/lock | cut -d"@" -f1)"'
```

## Product License Installation

Once running, the IQ Server product license must be installed. This should be done [using the user interface](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/installing/iq-server-installation#IQServerInstallation-InstalltheLicense).

Default admin credentials are: `admin` / `admin123`

### Version 96 or Later
The IQ Server product license is stored in the database and so will survive image restarts as long as the database is
persisted.

### Version 95 or Earlier
The IQ Server product license is stored using Java preferences API. By default, the directory location is already
customized by a Java system property to be under the sonatype-work directory i.e.
`-Djava.util.prefs.userRoot=${SONATYPE_WORK}/javaprefs` so as to survive image restarts.

If customized using `JAVA_OPTS`, the absolute path to user prefs must point to an already created directory readable by the user account owning the process.

Under the preferences directory, IQ Server will store the installed license file at a path ./com/sonatype/clm/prefs.xml

## Building the Nexus IQ Server image

To build a docker image from the Dockerfile you can use this command:

    docker build --rm=true --tag=sonatype/nexus-iq-server .

The following optional variables can be used when building the image:

- IQ_SERVER_VERSION: Version of Nexus IQ Server
- IQ_SERVER_SHA256: Check hash matches the downloaded IQ Server archive or else fail build. Required if `IQ_SERVER_VERSION` is provided.
- SONATYPE_WORK: Path to Nexus IQ Server working directory where variable data is stored
- LOGS_HOME: Path to Nexus IQ Server directory where logs are stored
- GID: GID of the user group used when running the image
- UID: UID of the user used when running the image

### Customizing the Default config.yml

The `config.yml` file can be used to customize the Nexus IQ Server configuration.
See [IQ Server Configuration](https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/configuring) for more details as to what values
are supported.

## Extending the Nexus IQ Server Image

If you would like to use this image as the basis for another image that adds additional packages,
take note that different versions of the image provide different package managers:

* Version 125 and newer provide `microdnf` as package manager.
* Version 101 and newer provide `dnf` as package manager.
* Version 100 and older provide `yum` as package manager.

## Testing the Dockerfile

We are using `rspec` as test framework. `serverspec` provides a docker backend (see the method `set` in the test code)
 to run the tests inside the docker container, and abstracts away the difference between distributions in the tests
 (e.g. yum, apt,...).

    rspec [--backtrace] spec/Dockerfile_spec.rb
    
## Alternative Slim Docker Image

The default Dockerfile includes:
* `git` for enhanced SCM Integrations

If you want an image without the extra tooling already installed, use the slim tag of the image:
`sonatype/nexus-iq-server:<version>-slim`, which can also be `sonatype/nexus-iq-server:latest-slim`.

## Red Hat Certified Image

A Red Hat certified container image can be created using Dockerfile.rh which pulls from assets in the red-hat-assets
folder. The image includes additional meta data to conform with Atomic and OpenShift standards, a directory with the
licenses applicable to the software and a man file for help on how to use the software.  It also uses an ENTRYPOINT
script to ensure the running user has access to the appropriate permissions for OpenShift 'restricted' SCC.
